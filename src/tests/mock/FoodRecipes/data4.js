  strInstructions: `For the Big Mac sauce, combine all the ingredients in a bowl, 
  season with salt and chill until ready to use.\r\n2. To make the patties, season 
  the mince with salt and pepper and form into 4 balls using about 1/3 cup mince 
  each. Place each onto a square of baking paper and flatten to form into four x 
  15cm circles. Heat oil in a large frypan over high heat. In 2 batches, cook beef 
  patties for 1-2 minutes each side until lightly charred and cooked through. 
  Remove from heat and keep warm. Repeat with remaining two patties.\r\n3. 
  Carefully slice each burger bun into three acrossways, then lightly toast.\r\n4. 
  To assemble the burgers, spread a little Big Mac sauce over the bottom base. Top 
  with some chopped onion, shredded lettuce, slice of cheese, beef patty and some 
  pickle slices. Top with the middle bun layer, and spread with more Big Mac sauce,
   onion, lettuce, pickles, beef patty and then finish with more sauce. Top with 
  burger lid to serve.\r\n5. After waiting half an hour for your food to settle, 
  go for a jog.`,

  strInstructions: `Cook the lentils. Bring lentils and 4 cups of water to a boil in a 
  medium pot or saucepan over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and cook until lentils 
  are just tender (15-17 minutes). Drain from water and season with a little salt. (Note: 
  when the lentils are ready, they should not be fully cooked. They should be only par-
  cooked and still have a bite to them as they need to finish cooking with the rice).\r\n
  Now, for the rice. Drain the rice from its soaking water. Combine the par-cooked lentils
 and the rice in the saucepan over medium-high heat with 1 tbsp cooking oil, salt, pepper,
  and coriander. Cook for 3 minutes, stirring regularly. Add warm water to cover the rice 
 and lentil mixture by about 1 1/2 inches (youâ€™ll probably use about 3 cups of water here)
  .Bring to a boil; the water should reduce a bit. Now cover and cook until all the liquid
   has been absorbed and both the rice and lentils are well cooked through (about 20 
  minutes).  Keep covered and undisturbed for 5 minutes or so.\r\nNow make the pasta. 
  While the rice and lentils are cooking, make the pasta according to package instructions
   by adding the elbow pasta to boiling water with a dash of salt and a little oil. Cook 
  until the pasta is al dente. Drain.\r\nCover the chickpeas and warm in the microwave 
  briefly before serving.\r\n\r\nMake the crispy onion topping. \r\n\r\nSprinkle the onion
  rings with salt, then toss them in the flour to coat. Shake off excess flour.\r\nIn a 
  large skillet, heat the cooking oil over medium-high heat, cook the onion rings, 
  stirring often, until they turn a nice caramelized brown. Onions must be crispy, 
  but not burned (15-20 minutes).`,
